PASSENGERS EVACUATED AS FIRE ERUPTS IN BATTERY BOX OF BHOPAL-DELHI VANDE BHARAT TRAIN
VANDE BHARAT EXPRESS CATCHES FIRE.
BHOPAL: A FIRE BROKE OUT IN THE C-14 COACH OF THE VANDE BHARAT TRAIN TRAVELING FROM RANI KAMLAPATI IN BHOPAL TO NIZAMUDDIN NEAR BINA STATION IN SAGAR ON MONDAY MORNING.
ACCORDING TO EYEWITNESSES, THE FIRE ORIGINATED FROM THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT, LEADING TO PANIC AMONG PASSENGERS ON BOARD.
THE TRAIN NUMBER 20171 BHOPAL-HAZRAT NIZAMUDDIN VANDE BHARAT, COMMENCED ITS JOURNEY AT 5:40AM ON MONDAY.
THE FIRE BROKE OUT BEFORE REACHING BINA RAILWAY STATION, IN THE VICINITY OF KURWAI KETHORA. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, APPROXIMATELY 36 PASSENGERS WERE PRESENT IN THE AFFECTED COACH.

THE TRAIN WAS HALTED AT KURWAI KETHORA AROUND 7:10AM, AND ALL PASSENGERS WERE EVACUATED WITHOUT ANY INJURIES REPORTED. THE LOCAL FIRE BRIGADE TEAM ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AND EXTINGUISHED THE FLAMES.
SEVERAL PROMINENT INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING CONGRESS LEADER AJAY SINGH WERE IN THAT TRAIN.
AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, THE ENTIRE TRAIN WAS EVACUATED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT. LOCAL VILLAGERS RESIDING NEAR KURWAI KETHORA ALSO PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO THE FIRE BRIGADE TEAM IN COMBATING THE FIRE.

PASSENGERS WHO EXPERIENCED THE INCIDENT DESCRIBED THE PANIC THAT ENSUED WHEN THE SOUND OF FIRE EMERGED.
ONE OF THE PASSENGERS ONBOARD THE COACH SHARED HIS ACCOUNT, SAYING, "I HEARD THE SOUND OF FIRE EMANATING FROM BENEATH MY SEAT IN THE C-14 COACH. EVERYONE RUSHED TO SAFETY. WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED, I WITNESSED THE BATTERY BOX ABLAZE. UPON INFORMING THE GUARD, WE ALL DISEMBARKED WITH OUR BELONGINGS". HE WAS ENROUTE FROM BHOPAL TO DELHI.
ANOTHER PASSENGER SAID HE WAS TRAVELING FROM RANI KAMALAPATI TO GWALIOR WHEN SMOKE RAPIDLY FILLED BOTH SIDES OF THE COACH NEAR KURWAI. THE TRAIN WAS BROUGHT TO A HALT, AND ALL PASSENGERS WERE SAFELY EVACUATED, HE TOLD LOCAL MEDIA.
THE RANI KAMLAPATI-NIZAMUDDIN ROUTE SERVES AS MADHYA PRADESH'S INAUGURAL VANDE BHARAT TRAIN. IT WAS INAUGURATED FOUR MONTHS AGO, ON APRIL 1, BY PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI.
THE TRAIN INITIALLY TRAVELLED TO AGRA ON ITS MAIDEN JOURNEY. OFFICIAL OPERATIONS COMMENCED ON APRIL 2, WITH SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM NIZAMUDDIN TO RANI KAMALAPATI. ON APRIL 3, THE TRAIN MADE ITS RETURN JOURNEY FROM KAMALAPATI TO NIZAMUDDIN.
SOON, THE FIRE BRIGADE REACHED THE SITE AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE, REPORTED NEWS AGENCY ANI QUOTING INDIAN RAILWAYS.
RAILWAYS SAID THAT ALL PASSENGERS ARE SAFE. AND NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED.
"FIRE WAS LIMITED TO BATTERY BOX ONLY AND FIRE IS EXTINGUISHED. BATTERY BOX IS LOCATED IN THE UNDERGEAR, RELATIVELY AWAY FROM THE PASSENGER AREA. AS THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, ELECTRICAL SAFETY SYSTEMS ISOLATED THE BATTERIES. FIRE EXTINGUISHED AND DEFECTIVE BATTERIES TAKEN OFF. TRAIN IS READY TO MOVE," SAID RAILWAYS.

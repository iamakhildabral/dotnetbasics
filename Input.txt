NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old man was stabbed to death in northeast Delhi’s Jafrabad on Monday.
The victim, Salman, was stabbed in the neck and chest by the family members of a woman he was in a relationship with.
Police received a call at around 5.15pm reporting a stabbing in gali number-2 near Kalyan Cinema in Jafrabad's Chauhan Banger. When they arrived at the scene, they found Salman lying on the ground, dead.
Preliminary investigation revealed that Salman had been friends with the woman for the past two years. Her family was opposed to their relationship, and they had allegedly threatened Salman on several occasions.
The police have registered a case of murder and are currently investigating the matter.
On Monday, her father Manzoor, along with his elder son Mohsin and the younger son who is a minor, attacked Salman, while he was on a motorcycle, he said.
Manzoor and his sons, who all are absconding, have been booked for murder and are being looked for, Tirkey added.

Vande Bharat Express catches fire.
BHOPAL: A fire broke out in the C-14 coach of the Vande Bharat train traveling from Rani Kamlapati in Bhopal to Nizamuddin near Bina station in Sagar on Monday morning.
According to eyewitnesses, the fire originated from the battery compartment, leading to panic among passengers on board.
The train number 20171 Bhopal-Hazrat Nizamuddin Vande Bharat, commenced its journey at 5:40am on Monday.
The fire broke out before reaching Bina railway station, in the vicinity of Kurwai Kethora. At the time of the incident, approximately 36 passengers were present in the affected coach.

The train was halted at Kurwai Kethora around 7:10am, and all passengers were evacuated without any injuries reported. The local fire brigade team arrived at the scene and extinguished the flames.
Several prominent individuals including Congress leader Ajay Singh were in that train.
As a precautionary measure, the entire train was evacuated following the incident. Local villagers residing near Kurwai Kethora also provided assistance to the fire brigade team in combating the fire.

Passengers who experienced the incident described the panic that ensued when the sound of fire emerged.
One of the passengers onboard the coach shared his account, saying, "I heard the sound of fire emanating from beneath my seat in the C-14 coach. Everyone rushed to safety. When the train stopped, I witnessed the battery box ablaze. Upon informing the guard, we all disembarked with our belongings". He was enroute from Bhopal to Delhi.
Another passenger said he was traveling from Rani Kamalapati to Gwalior when smoke rapidly filled both sides of the coach near Kurwai. The train was brought to a halt, and all passengers were safely evacuated, he told local media.
The Rani Kamlapati-Nizamuddin route serves as Madhya Pradesh's inaugural Vande Bharat train. It was inaugurated four months ago, on April 1, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The train initially travelled to Agra on its maiden journey. Official operations commenced on April 2, with services available from Nizamuddin to Rani Kamalapati. On April 3, the train made its return journey from Kamalapati to Nizamuddin.
Soon, the fire brigade reached the site and extinguished the fire, reported news agency ANI quoting Indian Railways.
Railways said that all passengers are safe. and no injuries were reported.
"Fire was limited to battery box only and fire is extinguished. Battery box is located in the undergear, relatively away from the passenger area. As the incident occurred, electrical safety systems isolated the batteries. Fire extinguished and defective batteries taken off. Train is ready to move," said Railways.

Both countries would discuss the possibility of cooperation in digital technology, payment systems under central banks and using more local currency, the Indonesian FM said.
An Indian official later said that currency arrangement will be similar to the one with the UAE, and could see Indian exporters settle their trade in Indonesian rupiah, while those exporting, say, palm oil can earn in Indian rupees. Indonesia is India’s largest trading partner in the Asean region and is among the largest economies in Asia.

With bilateral trade of around $39 billion last year, it was India’s sixth largest trading partner and enjoyed a trade surplus of $19 billion, thanks to large shipments of palm oil and petroleum. Refined petroleum products were India’s largest export item.

The Indian official said there was significant interest in India’s digital public infrastructure from countries and after Singapore, the UAE and France, Indonesia could be among those that “take one of the bricks from the India stack”.


Following her meeting with the Indonesian FM, Sitharaman said: “The areas of cooperation include bilateral investment, financial services and infrastructure development, among others. For instance, India has developed expertise in digital public infrastructure. It can provide time-tested solutions for convenient and affordable digital payments, which can assist Indonesia in achieving its financial inclusion goals.”

MakeMyTrip Foundation commits Rs 5 crore towards relief efforts in HP, Uttarakhand
MakeMyTrip on Monday said that in the wake of the unprecedented devastation in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, MakeMyTrip Foundation has initiated the immediate deployment of Rs 5 crore towards relief efforts.
The company said the Foundation will work with a network of on-ground partners, government bodies, experts, NGOs, and locals to help operationalize immediate relief efforts.
“There is an urgent need to send essential resources to aid the people of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as they grapple with the extensive damages caused by the recent flooding," said Deep Kalra, founder and chairman of MakeMyTrip and Trustee of MakeMyTrip Foundation. "The current situation in these states is trying, and requires a collective effort by each and every one of us. Small contributions will go a long way in aiding the emergency response action and enhance the quality of lives of the local communities who play host to us when we visit their home state, Kalra added.
Monsoon Fury
The number of fatalities in North India is on the rise as the region continues to be battered by torrential rains. Among all the affected states, Himachal Pradesh remains the hardest hit, with 117 reported deaths in the state.
According to Himachal Pradesh Disaster Management Authority data, "Monsoon has claimed 117 lives since its onset on June 24 in Himachal Pradesh. Till now 12 people are missing and 121 people have been injured."

The state has witnessed 53 incidents of landslides in the state besides 41 incidents of flash floods, the data read.
Meanwhile, the IMD India Meteorological Department (IMD) has already issued red and orange alerts in Uttarakhand due to the rising water level of Ganga in Haridwar and incessant rainfall lashing several parts of the state.
